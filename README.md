  	When taking serious the tools that i use, i`m deeping in Rust to know what do best with it
- ### Open Source Development
  	Spending some time and working a lil`bit on OS development
- ### Bitcoin Development
  	Recently i've studying all the bitcoin surrounds and features, my focus being criptography and decentralized trust technology. 
- ### Academic Life
	Since I'm a enthusiastic of Math and basically everything that i find interesting, as interesting i say something logically challenging, i acquired the "free-soul" to my academics goal.
