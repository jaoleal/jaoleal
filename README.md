# João Leal

Hi, name's **jão** (according google translate, sounds "jaan"), a Brazilian **Software Developer** entering higher education in computer science course. As a newly developer, the best that i can say about me is mine passions and goals:

- ## Tools

  	Talking about what i use to get the job done, at the moment im delving deeper into
  	- [**Rust**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
	- [**YavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript)
   	- [**Nix**](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/)

  	  trying to use it in every project. I also have some experience with:
	And pretending to learn:
	- [Go](https://golang.org/).
	- [Htmx](https://htmx.org/).


- ## Focus
	### Game Development
  	
	The first reason that made me begin to study programming was the game development, so i'm always trying to learn more about it and i consider myself an enthusiast.

	### Bitcoin Development

  	Recently i've studying all the bitcoin surrounds and features, my focus being criptography and decentralized trust technology.
	In 2024 i became a member of [Vinteum](https://vinteum.com.br/), a brazilian company that develops bitcoin solutions, and through recommendations from the organization im developing at the [Summer of Bitcoin](https://summerofbitcoin.org/) program. 

- ## Academic Life

	Since I'm a enthusiastic of Math and basically everything that i find logically challenging, i acquired the "free-soul" to my academics goal.
