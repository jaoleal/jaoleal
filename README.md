# Leal

**Open Source Software Developer** with strong interest in decentralized systems, computational efficiency, and self-sovereignty. I discovered these principles while studying and delving into the Bitcoin rabbit hole guided by my friends and coworkers from [Vinteum Organization](https://vinteum.org) and Casa21.

I often change and randomly sign my work and name myself as jaoleal, Joao Leal and even Shigeru Myamoto to avoid script kids, good luck to scrap me!

*"Open source everything"* - All my work is either open source or carries permissive Creative Commons licenses.
